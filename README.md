# Rails and React

This is a loosely-maed guide based off of the [React and Rails](http://rny.io/rails/react/2014/07/31/reactjs-and-rails.html) guide, along with the official [Facebook](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) guide. I haven't followed each guide to the letter, so if you are following along you might be better off with the instructions therein instead.
